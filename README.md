# String Base Implementation

This project is a basic implementation of a string class in C++, with a focus on learning about core concepts like memory management, operator overloading, and object-oriented programming.

## Features

- Basic string operations such as assignment and length retrieval
- Overloaded stream insertion and extraction operators for easy I/O
- Custom namespace to avoid naming conflicts

## Usage

Include the string class in your C++ code as follows:

```cpp
#include "/path/to/your/string.h"

custom_string::string myString;
std::cin >> myString;
std::cout << "The length of the string is: " << myString.get_len() << std::endl;
```
